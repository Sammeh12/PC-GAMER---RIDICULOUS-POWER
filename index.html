      <h2>PC GAMER - RIDICULOUS POWER</h2>
      <img src="images/home.png">
      <p>When money isn't a barrier, an extreme PC build is the path toward gaming greatness. A build like this will run Elden Ring at 4K without flinching. There's almost nothing that gets in the way of the best CPU for gaming and the best graphics card combined into one rig. You'll be futureproofed and equipped to play any game out there today.
        <br><br>
        Just how much is this behemoth of a computer going to cost, you ask? Well, you're looking at around $4,000. Fiscally responsible PC gamers looking for a more cost-effective build, designed with value per frame in mind, can check out our high-end PC build guide. For those who aren't concerned with money, this is the build for you. Though, if you were looking for places to save, a smaller SSD or slightly slower RAM can shave off a few hundred dollars from the final cost.
        <br><br>
        The final price doesn't include accessories or peripherals, so if you're going all-in on 4K gaming, you should pick yourself up a gaming monitor that'll make the most out of your GPU. Don't bottleneck your high-powered components with a super out-of-date gaming monitor.
        <br><br>
        We've tested excessive numbers of components throughout the years, and put together all the best bits here. It's a true monster of a gaming PC with little to no care about cost, and the PC of our dreams.
